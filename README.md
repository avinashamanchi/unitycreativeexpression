# Unity Creative Expression Project

## Overview 
In this project, I chose to create a 3D visual animation. My animation uses the new Unity engine we learned about, enabling me to create spheres that collide with planes. When the spheres knock down the planes, an audio clip plays, forming a sentence. I also designed a unique background featuring mountains and vibrant colors, using various layers and assets. The effect of the planes represents dominoes, while the spheres resemble objects being thrown at a wall. The project uses color theory and design principles to evoke emotions, as the images on the planes and spheres are of people intended to provoke emotional responses. The actions they perform add a humorous element to the project, making it even more engaging.
